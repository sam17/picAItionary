# Drawing System Setup Guide

## Overview
The drawing system now works completely for both creating and displaying drawings in local and multiplayer modes.

## Components

### 1. Drawing Creation (DrawingScreen)
- **UIDrawingCanvas**: Interactive drawing component
- **DrawingToolsController**: Brush controls (size, color, undo, etc.)

### 2. Drawing Display (GuessingScreen)
- **DrawingDisplayCanvas**: Read-only display component

## Unity Scene Setup

### DrawingScreen GameObject Setup
1. Add `UIDrawingCanvas` component to the drawing area GameObject
2. Add `RawImage` component (if not auto-added)
3. Configure:
   - Texture Width: 512
   - Texture Height: 512
   - Brush Size: 5
   - Brush Color: Black
   - Smooth Lines: true

### DrawingTools GameObject Setup
1. Add `DrawingToolsController` component
2. Link the UIDrawingCanvas in the Canvas Reference field
3. Connect UI elements:
   - Brush Size Slider
   - Color Buttons (create buttons with Image components)
   - Undo/Redo/Clear buttons
   - Eraser Toggle

### GuessingScreen GameObject Setup
1. On the `drawingDisplay` GameObject referenced in GuessingScreen:
   - Add `DrawingDisplayCanvas` component
   - Add `RawImage` component (if not auto-added)
   - Configure:
     - Texture Width: 512
     - Texture Height: 512
     - Background Color: White
   - **Important**: Make sure RawImage.raycastTarget = false (to prevent interactions)

## Data Flow

### Local Mode
1. Player draws on DrawingScreen → UIDrawingCanvas
2. Drawing submitted → GameController stores in currentRoundData
3. State changes to Guessing
4. GuessingScreen loads drawing from currentRoundData
5. DrawingDisplayCanvas shows the drawing

### Multiplayer Mode
1. Drawer creates drawing → UIDrawingCanvas
2. Drawing submitted to server → GameController
3. Server distributes via DistributeDrawingToClientsClientRpc
4. All clients receive drawing data in currentRoundData
5. Non-drawers see GuessingScreen with drawing displayed

## Testing Checklist

### Local Mode
- [ ] Drawing appears while creating
- [ ] Tools work (brush size, colors, undo)
- [ ] Drawing shows on guessing screen
- [ ] Drawing data persists through state changes

### Multiplayer Mode
- [ ] Drawer can create drawing
- [ ] Other players see "waiting" screen during drawing
- [ ] All guessers see the drawing
- [ ] Drawing quality is preserved over network

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Drawing not visible while drawing
- Check UIDrawingCanvas has RawImage component
- Verify texture is created (512x512)
- Check Canvas render mode matches camera setup

### Drawing not showing on GuessScreen
- Verify drawingDisplay GameObject has DrawingDisplayCanvas
- Check IDrawingCanvas interface is implemented
- Ensure drawing data is not null/empty

### Offset between mouse and drawing
- Already fixed in UIDrawingCanvas
- Uses proper RectTransform coordinate conversion

### Performance issues
- Already optimized with pixel buffer
- Texture.Apply() limited to 60fps
- SetPixels used instead of SetPixel

## Color/Tool Settings
- Brush sizes: 2, 5, 10, 15 pixels
- Colors: Black, Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Purple, Brown, Gray, White
- Eraser: Sets color to white
- Undo/Redo: Full stroke-based history

## Network Optimization
Drawing data is serialized as:
1. Stored as DrawingData with strokes
2. Converted to byte[] via JSON
3. Sent via Netcode RPC
4. Reconstructed on clients
5. Rendered to texture

The system is fully functional and optimized!
