PicAItionary: A Misdirection Drawing Game  
Objective: The goal is for humans to mislead the AI with creative drawings, while still trying to convey a recognizable word. The AI has to guess based on the drawing, but humans can confuse it with clever misdirection.  
How to Play: 
One person draws a word from a list of words suggested. The one to draw is highlighted. The AI and other humans are shown the same list of words.
The AI guesses what the drawing is. The other human also guesses.  Humans try to mislead the AI with a tricky or vague drawing, while still giving enough hints for themselves to guess it.  

Points: If AI and human both guess, both get 0. If AI guesses and human does not, human gets -1 and AI guesses +1. If human guesses and AI does not, human gets +1 and AI gets -1.
